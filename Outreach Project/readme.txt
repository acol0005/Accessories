Requirements for running the 'simulator':
-Python 3.0+
-PyQt5
-NumPy
-images folder (included in zip)

To run the sim:
-open a console (terminal, cmd, etc.)
-navigate to the main sim folder
-enter 'python3 outreach_gui.py'

Making alterations:
Images of the rocket used are from OpenRocket with some light editing in Photoshop.
For another rocket, replacing the resources in the 'images' folder with images with the same name and filetype will mean the sim runs unaffected.
